this simple application will tell you whether to buy a frigate in no mans sky. just type ./nmsworthit followed by either the word main for any non support ship, or type support. Next type the num of expeditions. follow that by either the number of the main stat, or type the four stats in(ie if it's a support with the stats 1 3 2 4, and been on 3 expeditions type ./nmsworthit support 3 1 3 2 4).
